The source code for the setproctitle module has moved to GitHub:

  * https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle

The source has been migrated away from Google Code because of the silly password required for pushing changes. I can't stand the missing public key authentication.

The repository has also been converted to Git format: you can use
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle.git<br>
</pre>
to clone it.
